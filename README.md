How to use it?
---------------------

The [Spacenet6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06500) dataset needs to be downloaded prior to running the main notebook. 

The code was implemented in Python(3.8) and PyTroch(1.14.0) on Windows OS. The *segmentation models pytorh* library is used as a baseline for implementation. 
Apart from main data science libraries, RS-specific libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, and tifffile are also required.
